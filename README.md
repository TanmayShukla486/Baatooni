Baatooni: Real-time Communication App (In Development)
Baatooni (meaning "conversations" in [language you prefer]) is a mobile application I'm currently developing that empowers seamless real-time communication for individuals and groups.

Key Features:

Live Chat with Socket.IO: Leverages Socket.IO, a real-time communication library, to enable low-latency chat functionality. Users can experience instant messaging without delays, fostering a more interactive and engaging communication experience.
Group Chats: Facilitates discussions and collaboration among multiple users. Individuals can create groups, invite others, and engage in real-time conversations, making it ideal for project teams, communities, or friend circles.
Private Chats: Provides a secure and dedicated space for one-on-one communication. Users can enjoy private conversations with enhanced privacy and focus.
Multimedia Sharing: Enhances communication by allowing users to share images, videos, and other multimedia content within chats. This can enrich conversations and provide additional context.
Video and Voice Calls: Integrates video and voice calling functionality, enabling users to connect face-to-face or have audio-only conversations. This elevates communication beyond text messages and fosters a more personal connection.
